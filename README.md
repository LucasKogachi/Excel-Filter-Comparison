# Excel Filter & Comparison

## Overview
This Excel Project is a Simple Tool using Excel VBA to Filter and Compare DATA.

## How it Works

There are 3 Basic Sheets:
+ Menu
+ Input
+ Output

To understand how it works, itâ€™s better to look into what the project can do.

### Menu Sheet

Here you can:
+ Add Filter Sheets
+ Add Comparison Sheets
+ Run those Filters and Comparisons
+ Remove Duplicates from Input Sheet
+ Sort Input Sheet(Ascending)
+ Sort Output Sheet(Ascending)

The difference between Filter and Comparison is that Filter Paints Input and the rest goes to Output (Rows not Painted), while Comparison just Paints Output.

### Filters Sheets

You can choose the number of columns to be compared with the Input Sheet and choose a color that will fill the Input Cells when equal, the rows that were NOT a match will be copied to the Output Sheet.

### Comparisons Sheets

You can choose the number of columns to be compared with the Output Sheet and choose a color that will fill the Output Cells when equal.

### Examples
